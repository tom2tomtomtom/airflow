## 2025-01-25: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

AIRWAVE is positioned as a comprehensive AI-powered video marketing platform targeting marketing agencies, content creators, and SMB marketing teams. The platform combines AI content generation, template-based video creation, campaign management, and multi-platform distribution in a unified workflow.

### Context

The video marketing industry lacks integrated solutions that combine strategic planning with efficient video production. Most tools focus on either creation or distribution, requiring multiple platforms and manual workflow management. AIRWAVE addresses this gap by providing end-to-end video marketing campaign management with AI-powered content generation.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Video Editing Tool Focus**
   - Pros: Simpler scope, established market patterns
   - Cons: Commoditized market, limited differentiation

2. **AI Content Generation Only**
   - Pros: AI-first positioning, technical differentiation
   - Cons: Limited practical application without distribution

3. **Campaign Management Platform**
   - Pros: Business-focused value proposition
   - Cons: Requires integration with multiple creation tools

### Rationale

The integrated approach provides unique value by eliminating tool switching and workflow fragmentation. AI-powered content generation combined with template-based video creation addresses both strategic planning and efficient execution needs of target users.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Comprehensive platform creates strong customer lock-in
- AI integration provides sustainable competitive advantage
- Template system ensures consistent quality and brand compliance
- Multi-platform support addresses complete customer workflow

**Negative:**

- Complex platform requires significant development resources
- Multiple integration points increase technical complexity
- Broader scope may dilute focus on core video creation features

## 2025-01-25: Technical Architecture Foundation

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Selected Next.js with TypeScript, Supabase backend, and AI service integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs) as the core technical architecture. Material-UI for component library with Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Context

Platform requires rapid development with strong type safety, real-time capabilities, and seamless AI service integration. Team expertise in React ecosystem and need for scalable database solution influenced technology choices.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Pure Node.js Backend**
   - Pros: Full control over API design, microservices potential
   - Cons: Additional development overhead, deployment complexity

2. **Firebase + React**
   - Pros: Google AI integration, established patterns
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, limited SQL capabilities for complex queries

3. **Custom UI Framework**
   - Pros: Unique design system, full control
   - Cons: Development time, maintenance overhead

### Rationale

Next.js provides excellent developer experience with built-in optimization and API routes. Supabase offers PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities and built-in authentication. Material-UI accelerates UI development while maintaining professional appearance. TypeScript ensures code quality as team scales.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Rapid development velocity with proven frameworks
- Type safety reduces bugs and improves developer confidence
- Real-time database capabilities support collaboration features
- Strong ecosystem support for AI service integrations

**Negative:**

- Vendor dependencies on Supabase and Vercel/Netlify
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with chosen stack
- Potential performance limitations with large bundle sizes

## 2025-01-25: Code Quality and Refactoring Priority

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Prioritize systematic code quality improvements through Agent OS workflow, targeting monolithic component refactoring, code duplication elimination, and TypeScript strict mode adoption before new feature development.

### Context

Current codebase health score of 42/100 indicates significant technical debt that impacts development velocity and code maintainability. Previous experience with "6000+ TypeScript errors" demonstrates risks of uncontrolled technical debt accumulation.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Continue Feature Development**
   - Pros: Immediate business value, visible progress
   - Cons: Compounding technical debt, reduced development velocity

2. **Complete Rewrite**
   - Pros: Clean architecture, modern patterns
   - Cons: Significant time investment, business risk

3. **Gradual Refactoring During Feature Work**
   - Pros: Incremental improvement, continued feature delivery
   - Cons: Inconsistent progress, potential for incomplete refactoring

### Rationale

Systematic refactoring using Agent OS methodology provides structured approach to technical debt reduction while maintaining business continuity. Addressing largest complexity issues first (video-studio.tsx) provides maximum impact. Code quality foundation enables faster future development.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Reduced development time for future features (estimated 25-30% improvement)
- Improved code maintainability and team onboarding experience
- Better testing capabilities and lower bug rates
- Sustainable development practices for platform scaling

**Negative:**

- Temporary reduction in new feature delivery
- Risk of introducing bugs during refactoring process
- Team time investment without immediate visible business value

## 2025-01-25: AI Integration Strategy

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Implement multi-AI provider strategy with OpenAI for content generation, Anthropic for content analysis, and ElevenLabs for voice generation. Maintain provider abstraction layer for future flexibility.

### Context

AI capabilities are core differentiator for AIRWAVE platform. Different AI providers excel in different areas, and platform benefits from leveraging best-in-class services for specific use cases. Vendor diversification reduces dependency risk.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single AI Provider (OpenAI Only)**
   - Pros: Simplified integration, consistent API patterns
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, limited specialized capabilities

2. **Custom AI Models**
   - Pros: Full control, potential cost optimization
   - Cons: Significant development investment, infrastructure complexity

3. **Open Source AI Integration**
   - Pros: Cost control, customization potential
   - Cons: Performance limitations, infrastructure requirements

### Rationale

Multi-provider approach provides access to specialized AI capabilities while maintaining flexibility. Abstraction layer enables provider switching without code changes. Current AI market is rapidly evolving, requiring adaptability.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Access to best-in-class AI capabilities for different use cases
- Reduced vendor dependency risk through diversification
- Flexibility to adapt to AI market changes and new technologies
- Cost optimization through provider selection for specific tasks

**Negative:**

- Increased integration complexity and maintenance overhead
- Multiple API patterns and rate limiting considerations
- Higher operational complexity for monitoring and error handling
