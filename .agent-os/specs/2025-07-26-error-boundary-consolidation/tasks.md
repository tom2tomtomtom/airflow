  - [ ] 2.4 Implement configurable fallback component support
  - [ ] 2.5 Implement reset mechanisms (manual, props change, keys change)
  - [ ] 2.6 Implement context-aware error handling and messaging
  - [ ] 2.7 Verify all new component tests pass

- [ ] 3. Integrate Error Reporting and Development Features
  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for error reporting integration (Sentry, logger, errorReporter)
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement consistent error reporting pipeline
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement error message sanitization for production
  - [ ] 3.4 Implement development-mode detailed error information
  - [ ] 3.5 Implement progressive disclosure UI for technical details
  - [ ] 3.6 Verify all error reporting integration tests pass

- [ ] 4. Create Higher-Order Component and Hook Patterns
  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for withErrorBoundary HOC pattern
  - [ ] 4.2 Implement withErrorBoundary HOC with configuration support
  - [ ] 4.3 Write tests for useErrorHandler hook
  - [ ] 4.4 Implement useErrorHandler hook for functional components
  - [ ] 4.5 Create specialized components (FeatureErrorBoundary equivalent)
  - [ ] 4.6 Verify all HOC and hook tests pass

- [ ] 5. Migration and Compatibility Testing
  - [ ] 5.1 Write migration tests to ensure backward compatibility
  - [ ] 5.2 Create migration guide and documentation
  - [ ] 5.3 Test new component against all existing usage scenarios
  - [ ] 5.4 Implement feature flags for gradual rollout if needed
  - [ ] 5.5 Verify all migration compatibility tests pass

- [ ] 6. Replace Existing ErrorBoundary Implementations
  - [ ] 6.1 Write tests to verify successful migration of components/ErrorBoundary.tsx usage
  - [ ] 6.2 Update all imports from components/ErrorBoundary.tsx to use UnifiedErrorBoundary
  - [ ] 6.3 Write tests to verify successful migration of components/error/ErrorBoundary.tsx usage
  - [ ] 6.4 Update all imports from components/error/ErrorBoundary.tsx to use UnifiedErrorBoundary
  - [ ] 6.5 Write tests to verify successful migration of components/workflow/ErrorBoundary.tsx usage
  - [ ] 6.6 Update all imports from components/workflow/ErrorBoundary.tsx to use UnifiedErrorBoundary
  - [ ] 6.7 Write tests to verify successful migration of components/ui/ErrorBoundary/ErrorBoundary.tsx usage
  - [ ] 6.8 Update all imports from components/ui/ErrorBoundary/ErrorBoundary.tsx to use UnifiedErrorBoundary
  - [ ] 6.9 Verify all migration tests pass and functionality is preserved

- [ ] 7. Cleanup and Optimization
  - [ ] 7.1 Write tests to verify old ErrorBoundary files can be safely removed
  - [ ] 7.2 Remove old ErrorBoundary implementation files
  - [ ] 7.3 Update any remaining references or documentation
  - [ ] 7.4 Verify bundle size reduction meets expectations (~600-700 lines)
  - [ ] 7.5 Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
  - [ ] 7.6 Verify all cleanup tests pass

- [ ] 8. Documentation and Final Verification
  - [ ] 8.1 Create comprehensive documentation for the new UnifiedErrorBoundary API
  - [ ] 8.2 Update component usage examples and best practices
  - [ ] 8.3 Create troubleshooting guide for common error scenarios
  - [ ] 8.4 Run end-to-end tests to verify complete functionality
  - [ ] 8.5 Verify all existing error handling scenarios still work correctly
  - [ ] 8.6 Generate and review bundle analysis report
  - [ ] 8.7 Verify all documentation is complete and accurate
