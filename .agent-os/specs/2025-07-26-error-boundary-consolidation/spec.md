# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Error Boundary Consolidation
> Created: 2025-07-26
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Consolidate the 4 duplicate ErrorBoundary implementations in the AIRWAVE codebase into a single, unified, and configurable error boundary system that provides consistent error handling, reduces code duplication by ~1,100 lines, and improves maintainability across the application.

## User Stories

### Developer Experience Improvement

As a developer working on the AIRWAVE codebase, I want to use a single, consistent ErrorBoundary component so that I can focus on feature development rather than maintaining multiple error handling implementations.

This involves creating a unified ErrorBoundary that can be configured for different contexts (page-level, section-level, component-level) while providing consistent error reporting, user experience, and debugging capabilities across all usage scenarios.

### Error Handling Consistency

As a user of the AIRWAVE application, I want to see consistent error messages and recovery options when something goes wrong, so that I have a predictable experience regardless of where the error occurs.

This requires standardizing the error UI, recovery mechanisms, and error reporting across all components while maintaining context-appropriate messaging and functionality.

### Code Maintainability

As a technical lead maintaining the AIRWAVE codebase, I want to reduce technical debt by eliminating duplicate error boundary implementations so that bug fixes and improvements only need to be made in one place.

This involves analyzing the existing implementations, extracting their best features, and creating a single source of truth for error boundary functionality.

## Spec Scope

1. **Analysis of Existing Implementations** - Deep dive into the 4 current ErrorBoundary components to understand their patterns, differences, and unique features
2. **Unified ErrorBoundary Design** - Create a single, configurable ErrorBoundary component that can handle all current use cases
3. **Migration Strategy** - Plan the systematic replacement of all existing ErrorBoundary implementations
4. **Error Reporting Integration** - Ensure consistent error reporting across all contexts (Sentry, logging, etc.)
5. **Comprehensive Testing** - Create thorough test coverage for the new unified component and migration process

## Out of Scope

- Changing the underlying React error boundary lifecycle methods
- Modifying the existing error reporting services (Sentry, logger)
- Redesigning the overall error handling strategy beyond consolidation
- Performance optimizations beyond code reduction

## Expected Deliverable

1. A single, feature-complete ErrorBoundary component that can replace all 4 existing implementations
2. All existing ErrorBoundary imports updated to use the new unified component
3. Comprehensive test suite covering all error boundary scenarios and contexts
4. Documentation for the new ErrorBoundary API and configuration options
5. Verification that all existing error handling functionality is preserved or improved
