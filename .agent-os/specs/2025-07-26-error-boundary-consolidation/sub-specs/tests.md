> Created: 2025-07-26
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**UnifiedErrorBoundary Component**

- Should render children when no error occurs
- Should catch and display error when error is thrown in children
- Should generate unique error IDs for each error occurrence
- Should call onError callback when error is caught
- Should reset error state when resetError is called
- Should reset error state when resetKeys change
- Should reset error state when resetOnPropsChange is enabled and props change
- Should apply correct styling based on level prop (page/section/component)
- Should use custom fallback component when provided
- Should show/hide technical details based on showDetails prop
- Should sanitize error messages in production mode
- Should preserve full error details in development mode

**Error Reporting Integration**

- Should integrate with Sentry when available
- Should call logger with structured error information
- Should use errorReporter utility for consistent reporting
- Should include context and feature information in error reports
- Should sanitize sensitive information from error messages
- Should handle error reporting failures gracefully

**HOC Pattern (withErrorBoundary)**

- Should wrap components with error boundary
- Should pass through all props to wrapped component
- Should maintain component display name
- Should support error boundary configuration options

**Hook Pattern (useErrorHandler)**

- Should provide error handler function
- Should throw errors to be caught by nearest error boundary
- Should support additional error context information

### Integration Tests

**Error Boundary Level Behavior**

- Page-level error boundary should display full-screen error UI
- Section-level error boundary should display inline error UI
- Component-level error boundary should display minimal error UI
- Error boundaries should not interfere with each other when nested

**Migration Compatibility**

- New error boundary should handle all existing error scenarios from components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
- New error boundary should handle all existing error scenarios from components/error/ErrorBoundary.tsx
- New error boundary should handle all existing error scenarios from components/workflow/ErrorBoundary.tsx
- New error boundary should handle all existing error scenarios from components/ui/ErrorBoundary/ErrorBoundary.tsx
- All existing error boundary props and configurations should work with new implementation

**Error Reporting Flow**

- Errors should be logged to console in development mode
- Errors should be sent to Sentry in production mode
- Error reports should include all required context information
- Sensitive information should be sanitized in production error reports

**UI Interaction Tests**

- "Try Again" button should reset error state and re-render children
- "Go Home" button should navigate to home page (page-level only)
- "Reload Page" button should refresh the browser page
- "Report Bug" button should open email client with error details
- Technical details toggle should show/hide error stack information

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End Error Scenarios**

- User triggers JavaScript error in video studio - should see component-level error boundary
- User triggers network error during campaign creation - should see section-level error boundary
- User encounters critical application error - should see page-level error boundary
- User clicks "Try Again" after error recovery - should successfully continue workflow
- Developer encounters error in development mode - should see detailed technical information

**Cross-Browser Error Handling**

- Error boundaries should work consistently across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Error reporting should function properly in all supported browsers
- UI components should render correctly in different browser environments

**Mobile Responsive Error UI**

- Error boundaries should display appropriately on mobile devices
- Error messages should be readable on small screens
- Action buttons should be touch-friendly and accessible

### Mocking Requirements

**Error Boundary Testing**

- **React Error Simulation**: Mock components that throw errors for testing error boundary behavior
- **Console Methods**: Mock console.error to verify error logging without polluting test output
- **Window Location**: Mock window.location for testing navigation functionality
- **Sentry Integration**: Mock Sentry capture methods to verify error reporting without actual sends
- **Time-based Tests**: Mock Date.now() for consistent error ID generation in tests

**External Service Mocking**

- **Error Reporting Service**: Mock errorReporter.reportError to verify integration
- **Logger Service**: Mock logger methods to verify structured logging
- **Network Requests**: Mock fetch calls for error reporting API endpoints
- **Email Client**: Mock window.open for bug reporting functionality

**Environment Mocking**

- **NODE_ENV**: Mock process.env.NODE_ENV to test development vs production behavior
- **Window Objects**: Mock navigator.userAgent and window.location for error context
- **Sentry Availability**: Mock window.Sentry presence/absence for conditional integration testing

## Test Data Requirements

### Error Scenarios

```javascript
// Standard JavaScript errors
const typeError = new TypeError("Cannot read property 'x' of undefined");
const referenceError = new ReferenceError('someVariable is not defined');
const rangeError = new RangeError('Maximum call stack size exceeded');

// Network errors
const networkError = new Error('Network request failed');
networkError.name = 'NetworkError';

// Custom application errors
const validationError = new Error('Invalid user input');
validationError.name = 'ValidationError';
```

### Error Context Data

```javascript
const errorContexts = {
  page: 'video-studio',
  section: 'asset-library',
  component: 'upload-widget',
  feature: 'campaign-creation',
  workflow: 'video-rendering',
};
```

### Mock Error Info

```javascript
const mockErrorInfo = {
  componentStack: `
    at ErrorThrowingComponent
    at ErrorBoundary
    at App`,
  digest: 'mock-digest-123',
};
```

## Performance Testing

### Bundle Size Testing

- Measure bundle size before and after consolidation
- Verify expected reduction of ~600-700 lines
- Ensure no new dependencies are added to bundle

### Runtime Performance Testing

- Measure error boundary overhead during normal operation
- Test error handling performance under high error frequency
- Verify memory usage remains stable across error/recovery cycles

### Load Testing

- Test error boundary behavior under concurrent error conditions
- Verify error reporting doesn't impact application performance
- Test error boundary recovery under heavy application load
