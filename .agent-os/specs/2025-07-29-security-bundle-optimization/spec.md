> Spec: Security Vulnerability Patches & Bundle Optimization
> Created: 2025-07-29
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive security vulnerability patches and bundle optimization to address 6 moderate security vulnerabilities, reduce bundle size from 481KB to <300KB, and remove 5,554+ console statements to ensure production-ready security and performance standards.

## User Stories

### Secure Production Deployment

As a security-conscious platform operator, I want to patch all known vulnerabilities and optimize our bundle size, so that we can deploy to production safely without security risks and provide fast user experiences with minimal load times.

The current security vulnerabilities include outdated @sentry/nextjs (v7.0.0), vulnerable node-fetch (v2.7.0), and outdated @types/node (20.4.5). The 481KB bundle size exceeds performance targets, and 5,554+ console statements create security and performance risks in production. This implementation will systematically address each category of issues while maintaining full functionality.

### Performance-Optimized User Experience

As an end user of the AIRWAVE platform, I want faster page loads and optimized resource usage, so that I can create video content efficiently without waiting for heavy bundles to load or experiencing performance degradation.

The bundle optimization will remove 12 unused dependencies, consolidate duplicate chart libraries, and implement proper tree shaking for Material-UI imports. This will result in faster initial page loads, reduced memory usage, and improved overall platform responsiveness.

### Production-Ready Logging System

As a development team, I want a proper logging framework instead of console statements, so that we can maintain performance in production while having structured logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.

The console statement cleanup will replace 5,554+ debug statements with a structured logging system using the existing Pino integration, ensuring production performance while maintaining essential debugging capabilities through proper log levels and structured output.

## Spec Scope

1. **Security Vulnerability Patches** - Update all dependencies with known security vulnerabilities to their latest secure versions
2. **Bundle Size Optimization** - Reduce bundle size from 481KB to <300KB through dependency cleanup and tree shaking
3. **Console Statement Cleanup** - Remove all console.log/error/warn statements and implement structured logging
4. **Dependency Audit & Cleanup** - Remove 12+ unused dependencies and consolidate duplicate functionality
5. **Performance Validation** - Verify optimization improvements through bundle analysis and performance testing

## Out of Scope

- Major feature additions or UI changes
- Database schema modifications
- Authentication system changes
- AI service integrations updates (unless security-related)
- Third-party API endpoint changes

## Expected Deliverable

1. Zero security vulnerabilities detected in dependency scan
2. Bundle size reduced to under 300KB with maintained functionality
3. Complete removal of console statements except structured production logging
4. All existing tests passing with no regression in functionality
5. Documentation of optimization changes and performance improvements
