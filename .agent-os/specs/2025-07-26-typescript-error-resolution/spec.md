# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: TypeScript Error Resolution
> Created: 2025-07-26
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Systematically resolve 305+ TypeScript compilation errors blocking production build to achieve deployment readiness and improve code quality from 42/100 to 80+ health score. This critical Phase 1 task enables successful production builds while establishing strict TypeScript compliance across the AIRWAVE platform.

## User Stories

### Development Team Production Deployment

As a development team member, I want to successfully build the application for production deployment, so that we can ship features to users without TypeScript compilation blocking the build process.

**Detailed Workflow:** Currently, any attempt to build for production fails due to 305+ TypeScript errors spanning type mismatches, missing declarations, and jest namespace issues. The team needs a systematic approach to resolve these errors while maintaining existing functionality and establishing patterns for future type safety.

### Code Quality Improvement

As a platform maintainer, I want strict TypeScript compliance throughout the codebase, so that we maintain high code quality standards and prevent regression of type safety issues.

**Detailed Workflow:** The current health score of 42/100 is partially due to suppressed TypeScript errors. By resolving these systematically, we establish patterns for proper type handling, improve developer experience, and create a foundation for sustainable code quality.

### Build Process Optimization

As a DevOps engineer, I want builds to complete successfully without requiring 8GB heap memory workarounds, so that the deployment pipeline is efficient and reliable.

**Detailed Workflow:** Current builds fail with TypeScript errors and require excessive memory allocation. Resolving type errors reduces compilation complexity and memory requirements, enabling efficient CI/CD operations.

## Spec Scope

1. **TypeScript Error Analysis** - Comprehensive audit and categorization of all 305+ compilation errors
2. **Systematic Error Resolution** - Fix errors in logical groups using Test-Driven Development methodology
3. **Type Definition Creation** - Add missing type declarations for untyped modules and components
4. **Jest Configuration Fix** - Resolve Jest namespace conflicts and testing type issues
5. **Strict Mode Enablement** - Enable TypeScript strict mode after error resolution
6. **Build Process Validation** - Verify successful production builds without memory issues

## Out of Scope

- Major architectural refactoring beyond type safety improvements
- Migration to different TypeScript version (maintaining 5.1.6)
- Complete rewrite of components with complex type issues
- Performance optimization beyond build memory reduction
- Implementation of new features during error resolution

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Zero TypeScript compilation errors** - All 305+ errors resolved with successful production build
2. **Strict TypeScript mode enabled** - Full type safety compliance across the codebase
3. **Improved build performance** - Reduced memory requirements and faster compilation times
4. **Type safety documentation** - Guidelines for maintaining TypeScript compliance in future development
