### Build Process Validation

**Memory Usage Tests**

- Ensure consistent memory usage across build environments

**Performance Regression Tests**

- Measure TypeScript compilation time before and after fixes
- Test hot reload performance with type checking enabled
- Validate IDE responsiveness with strict type checking
- Monitor bundle size impact of type fixes

## Test Categories by Error Resolution Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation Testing

- **Import/Export Resolution**: Test all module imports resolve correctly
- **Type Declaration Loading**: Verify custom type definitions are accessible
- **Configuration Validation**: Test tsconfig.json changes don't break builds

### Phase 2: Component Integration Testing

- **Props Interface Testing**: Validate all component prop interfaces
- **State Management Types**: Test context and reducer type safety
- **Event Handler Types**: Verify form and user interaction type safety

### Phase 3: Testing Framework Validation

- **Jest Configuration**: Test updated Jest setup with TypeScript
- **Test Utility Types**: Validate testing helper function types
- **Mock Type Safety**: Ensure mocked dependencies maintain type safety

### Phase 4: Production Readiness Testing

- **Strict Mode Compilation**: Test complete codebase with strict TypeScript
- **Build Optimization**: Validate optimized production builds
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Test CI/CD integration with type checking

## Mocking Requirements

### Build Process Mocking

- **TypeScript Compiler API**: Mock for testing compilation scenarios
- **File System Operations**: Mock for testing file resolution
- **Memory Usage Monitoring**: Mock system resource monitoring

### Component Testing Mocks

- **External API Calls**: Mock AI service integrations during type testing
- **File Upload Operations**: Mock asset upload functionality
- **Database Operations**: Mock Supabase client calls for type testing

### Testing Framework Mocks

- **Next.js Router**: Mock routing for component type tests
- **Authentication Context**: Mock user authentication state
- **Environment Variables**: Mock configuration values for testing

## Validation Strategies

### Automated Validation

- Pre-commit hooks run TypeScript compilation checks
- CI/CD pipeline includes strict type checking validation
- Automated bundle size and memory usage monitoring
- Type coverage reporting in pull request checks

### Manual Validation

- Developer testing of critical user workflows after each phase
- Manual verification of IDE IntelliSense improvements
- User acceptance testing of form interactions with improved types
- Performance testing of development and build processes

### Regression Testing

- Existing unit and integration test suite execution
- End-to-end test validation after each error resolution phase
- Performance benchmark comparison before and after fixes
- User workflow testing to ensure no functionality regressions

## Success Criteria

### Type Safety Metrics

- Zero TypeScript compilation errors in strict mode
- Complete elimination of 'any' types in core business logic
- Full type coverage for all public component interfaces
- Successful type inference for all generic utility functions

### Build Performance Metrics

- Production build completion under 4GB memory usage
- TypeScript compilation time within acceptable limits (baseline + 10%)
- Successful hot reload with type checking enabled
- CI/CD pipeline builds complete without type-related failures

### Developer Experience Metrics

- Improved IDE IntelliSense and error reporting
- Faster development feedback with proper type checking
- Reduced runtime errors caught by TypeScript at compile-time
- Enhanced code maintainability through better type documentation
