# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-26-typescript-error-resolution/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-26
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### TypeScript Configuration Requirements

- Maintain TypeScript 5.1.6 compatibility with Next.js 14.2.5+
- Enable strict mode compilation after error resolution
- Preserve existing tsconfig.json structure while fixing compilation issues
- Maintain compatibility with Jest testing framework and React Testing Library

### Error Resolution Categories

- **Type Mismatches**: Fix incompatible type assignments and return types
- **Missing Declarations**: Add type definitions for untyped modules and components
- **Jest Namespace Issues**: Resolve testing framework type conflicts
- **Import/Export Issues**: Fix module resolution and declaration problems
- **Generic Type Issues**: Properly constrain and define generic type parameters

### Build Performance Requirements

- Reduce build memory requirements from 8GB to <4GB heap
- Maintain or improve build times during type checking
- Ensure successful production builds without type suppression
- Preserve hot reload functionality during development

### Code Quality Standards

- Follow existing AIRWAVE TypeScript patterns and conventions
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing component interfaces
- Preserve all existing functionality while improving type safety
- Use incremental approach to avoid breaking changes

## Approach Options

**Option A: Big Bang Approach**

- Pros: Complete resolution in single effort, immediate strict mode enablement
- Cons: High risk of breaking changes, difficult to test incrementally, potential for extended downtime

**Option B: Incremental Error Resolution by Category** (Selected)

- Pros: Systematic approach, testable at each step, maintains functionality, follows TDD principles
- Cons: Longer timeline, requires careful dependency management between error types

**Option C: File-by-File Resolution**

- Pros: Focused approach, easy to track progress
- Cons: May miss cross-file dependencies, inefficient for related errors across multiple files

**Rationale:** Option B provides the safest approach by grouping related errors, allowing for comprehensive testing at each stage, and maintaining the ability to rollback changes if issues arise. This aligns with AIRWAVE's emphasis on safety and incremental improvements.

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Error Analysis and Categorization

- Run comprehensive TypeScript compilation to capture all current errors
- Categorize errors by type (imports, types, jest, generics, etc.)
- Identify dependencies between error categories
- Create resolution roadmap based on dependency order

### Phase 2: Foundation Error Resolution

- Fix import/export declaration errors that block other fixes
- Resolve module resolution issues
- Add missing type declarations for core utilities
- Establish proper type declaration patterns

### Phase 3: Component Type Resolution

- Fix React component prop type mismatches
- Resolve state and event handler type issues
- Add proper generic constraints for reusable components
- Fix context and hook type definitions

### Phase 4: Testing Framework Integration

- Resolve Jest namespace conflicts
- Fix test file type issues
- Ensure proper type coverage for test utilities
- Validate testing framework compatibility

### Phase 5: Strict Mode Enablement

- Enable strict TypeScript compilation
- Fix any additional errors revealed by strict mode
- Validate all type assertions and any-types usage
- Ensure complete type safety compliance

## External Dependencies

**No new external dependencies required**

- All fixes will use existing TypeScript 5.1.6 capabilities
- Leverage existing type definition packages already in dependencies
- Use built-in Next.js and React type definitions

**Configuration Updates**

- **tsconfig.json modifications**: Enable strict mode after error resolution
- **Jest configuration**: Update type handling for testing framework
- **Next.js configuration**: Ensure proper TypeScript integration settings

## Performance Impact Assessment

### Build Performance Improvements

- Reduced TypeScript compilation complexity
- Lower memory usage during type checking
- Faster incremental builds with proper type caching
- Elimination of type suppression overhead

### Runtime Performance

- No impact on runtime performance (compile-time only changes)
- Improved developer experience with better IntelliSense
- Enhanced error catching during development
- Better code maintainability through type safety

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Testing Strategy

- Comprehensive test suite execution after each error resolution phase
- Automated type checking in CI/CD pipeline
- Manual testing of critical user workflows
- Rollback plan for each incremental change

### Safety Measures

- Git branch for each error resolution phase
- Incremental commits with clear descriptions
- Regular build validation during resolution process
- Preservation of existing functionality tests

### Monitoring and Validation

- Build success metrics tracking
- Memory usage monitoring during builds
- Type coverage reporting
- Developer experience feedback collection
