# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-26-typescript-error-resolution/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-26
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

- [x] 1. TypeScript Error Analysis and Categorization
  - [x] 1.1 Set up testing environment for TypeScript error analysis
  - [x] 1.2 Run comprehensive TypeScript compilation to capture all current errors
  - [x] 1.3 Create detailed error categorization by type (imports, declarations, jest, generics)
  - [x] 1.4 Map error dependencies and create resolution order priority matrix
  - [x] 1.5 Document current build memory usage and performance baseline
  - [x] 1.6 Verify all tests pass with current error suppression approach

- [ ] 2. Foundation Error Resolution (Import/Export and Module Declarations)
  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for module resolution and import/export functionality
  - [ ] 2.2 Fix import/export declaration errors that block other type fixes
  - [ ] 2.3 Resolve module resolution issues and missing path declarations
  - [ ] 2.4 Add missing type declarations for core utility modules
  - [ ] 2.5 Establish proper type declaration patterns for custom modules
  - [ ] 2.6 Verify all tests pass after foundation error resolution

- [ ] 3. Component Type Resolution
  - [ ] 3.1 Write comprehensive tests for React component prop interfaces
  - [ ] 3.2 Fix React component prop type mismatches and validation errors
  - [ ] 3.3 Resolve state management and event handler type issues
  - [ ] 3.4 Add proper generic constraints for reusable components
  - [ ] 3.5 Fix context provider and hook type definitions
  - [ ] 3.6 Update form handling with proper type safety
  - [ ] 3.7 Verify all tests pass after component type resolution

- [ ] 4. Testing Framework Integration Resolution
  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for Jest configuration and testing utility types
  - [ ] 4.2 Resolve Jest namespace conflicts and testing type errors
  - [ ] 4.3 Fix test file TypeScript compilation issues
  - [ ] 4.4 Update test utilities with proper type definitions
  - [ ] 4.5 Ensure React Testing Library integration maintains type safety
  - [ ] 4.6 Verify all tests pass with resolved testing framework types

- [ ] 5. Strict Mode Enablement and Final Validation
  - [ ] 5.1 Write comprehensive tests for strict TypeScript compilation
  - [ ] 5.2 Enable TypeScript strict mode in tsconfig.json
  - [ ] 5.3 Fix any additional errors revealed by strict mode enforcement
  - [ ] 5.4 Validate all type assertions and eliminate inappropriate 'any' usage
  - [ ] 5.5 Ensure complete type safety compliance across entire codebase
  - [ ] 5.6 Validate production build succeeds with memory optimization
  - [ ] 5.7 Verify all tests pass with strict TypeScript mode enabled

## Implementation Guidelines

### Test-Driven Development Approach

Each major task begins with comprehensive test writing to ensure:

- Current functionality is preserved during type fixes
- New type safety improvements are validated
- Regression testing catches any breaking changes
- Build process improvements are measurable

### Safety and Rollback Strategy

- Create feature branch for each major task phase
- Commit incrementally with clear descriptions of changes
- Maintain rollback capability at each major milestone
- Run full test suite after each task completion

### Performance Monitoring

- Track build memory usage throughout implementation
- Monitor TypeScript compilation time changes
- Measure developer experience improvements
- Validate CI/CD pipeline performance

### Quality Assurance

- Maintain zero regression in existing functionality
- Ensure all 305+ TypeScript errors are resolved
- Achieve successful production builds without type suppression
- Establish patterns for future TypeScript compliance
