# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Test Coverage Enhancement for Production Readiness
> Created: 2025-07-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Systematically increase AIRWAVE's test coverage from current 70% to 85%+ through targeted testing of critical untested components, API endpoints, and business logic to achieve our 90%+ health score target for production readiness.

## User Stories

### Development Team Quality Assurance

As a developer on the AIRWAVE team, I want comprehensive test coverage across all critical application components, so that I can confidently deploy features without introducing regressions that impact our marketing agency and content creator users.

The current 70% coverage leaves critical gaps in API endpoint testing, authentication flows, service layer business logic, and error handling edge cases. With 100 test files covering 432 source files, we need strategic test additions that focus on the highest-risk, most-used functionality rather than achieving coverage through trivial tests.

### Production Deployment Team

As a DevOps engineer preparing AIRWAVE for production deployment, I want test coverage above 85% with robust error handling and integration testing, so that I can ensure platform stability for marketing agencies managing multiple client accounts.

The enhanced test suite must cover authentication edge cases, AI service integration failures, file upload error scenarios, and database transaction rollbacks that could impact client campaigns and video creation workflows.

### Quality Assurance Team

As a QA engineer validating AIRWAVE's production readiness, I want systematic testing of all API endpoints and component integrations, so that marketing agencies can rely on consistent platform behavior when creating video campaigns under tight client deadlines.

Test coverage must include campaign creation workflows, video rendering pipelines, client management operations, and multi-platform export functionality that directly impacts user productivity and client satisfaction.

## Spec Scope

1. **API Endpoint Coverage Analysis** - Comprehensive audit and testing of all 40+ API routes with success/error scenarios
2. **Component Integration Testing** - Test React component interactions, state management, and prop handling for critical user workflows
3. **Service Layer Unit Testing** - Complete coverage of business logic in authentication, campaign management, and AI service integrations
4. **Authentication Flow Testing** - Cover login/logout, session management, permission checks, and security edge cases
5. **Error Handling Edge Cases** - Test failure scenarios for AI services, file uploads, database operations, and network timeouts

## Out of Scope

- UI visual regression testing (handled separately)
- Load testing and performance benchmarking (covered in performance optimization spec)
- Third-party service mocking beyond current AI integrations
- End-to-end browser automation beyond critical user journeys
- Legacy code refactoring not directly related to test coverage gaps

## Expected Deliverable

1. Test coverage increased from 70% to 85%+ with comprehensive reporting showing coverage improvements by module
2. All critical API endpoints have both success and error scenario tests with proper mocking of external dependencies
3. Authentication and authorization flows have complete test coverage including edge cases and security scenarios
4. Service layer business logic has unit tests covering all major code paths and error conditions
5. Integration tests validate component interactions and state management across video creation and campaign workflows
