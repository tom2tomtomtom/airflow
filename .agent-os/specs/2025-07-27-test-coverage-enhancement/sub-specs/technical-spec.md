# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-27-test-coverage-enhancement/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-27
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Coverage Analysis Requirements

- Generate detailed coverage reports using Jest's built-in coverage tools with lcov and html formats
- Identify untested functions, branches, and statements using coverage thresholds by module
- Prioritize testing based on code complexity metrics and user-facing functionality impact
- Track coverage improvements through automated reporting in CI/CD pipeline

### Testing Framework Requirements

- Utilize existing Jest framework (already configured) for unit and integration tests
- Leverage React Testing Library for component testing with proper user interaction simulation
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API endpoint mocking to ensure consistent test environments
- Implement Playwright for critical user journey E2E tests without over-relying on browser automation

### Quality Standards Requirements

- Maintain test reliability with deterministic assertions and proper async handling
- Ensure test independence with proper setup/teardown and isolated test environments
- Implement proper error boundary testing for React component failure scenarios
- Use TypeScript types in tests to catch testing errors during development

## Approach Options

**Option A: Incremental Coverage Improvement by Module**

- Pros: Manageable scope, can be done alongside other development, maintains quality focus
- Cons: Slower overall progress, may miss interdependencies between modules

**Option B: Comprehensive Test Suite Overhaul**

- Pros: Complete coverage quickly, addresses all gaps systematically, establishes testing patterns
- Cons: High time investment, risk of introducing flaky tests, potential development blocking

**Option C: Risk-Based Testing Prioritization** (Selected)

- Pros: Focuses on highest-impact areas first, balances coverage with business value, achieves target efficiently
- Cons: Requires careful prioritization analysis, may leave some lower-priority gaps initially

**Rationale:** Option C provides the best balance of achieving our 85%+ coverage target while focusing on the most critical functionality. By prioritizing API endpoints, authentication flows, and service layer business logic, we address the highest-risk areas that directly impact user experience and platform stability.

## Testing Strategy Implementation

### Phase 1: Critical Path Coverage (Target: 75% → 80%)

- API endpoint testing for authentication, campaigns, video creation, and client management
- Authentication service unit tests covering login, logout, session management, and permission checks
- Core business logic in campaign creation, video rendering coordination, and AI service integration

### Phase 2: Integration and Error Handling (Target: 80% → 85%)

- Component integration tests for video studio workflows and campaign management interfaces
- Error handling scenarios for AI service failures, file upload errors, and database transaction rollbacks
- State management testing for complex workflows using XState patterns

### Phase 3: Edge Cases and Optimization (Target: 85%+)

- Boundary condition testing for file uploads, API rate limiting, and large dataset handling
- Security edge cases for authentication bypasses and unauthorized access attempts
- Performance-related tests for memory usage and async operation handling

## External Dependencies

**No new major dependencies required** - leveraging existing testing infrastructure:

- **Jest** (already installed) - Core testing framework with coverage reporting
- **React Testing Library** (already installed) - Component testing utilities
- **MSW** (may need installation) - API mocking for consistent test environments
- **@testing-library/jest-dom** (already installed) - Extended Jest matchers for DOM elements

**Justification for MSW:** If not already installed, MSW provides the most reliable API mocking solution that works in both test and development environments, reducing flaky tests caused by network dependencies.

## Coverage Measurement Strategy

### Module-Based Coverage Targets

- **API Routes (/pages/api/):** 90%+ coverage with both success and error scenarios
- **Service Layer (/lib/services/):** 95%+ coverage of business logic functions
- **Authentication (/lib/auth/):** 100% coverage due to security criticality
- **Components (/components/):** 80%+ coverage focusing on user interaction and state changes
- **Utilities (/lib/utils/):** 85%+ coverage of helper functions and data transformations

### Quality Metrics Beyond Coverage

- Test execution time kept under 60 seconds for full suite to maintain developer productivity
- Zero flaky tests with proper async handling and deterministic assertions
- 100% TypeScript type coverage in test files to catch testing errors early
- Comprehensive error message testing to ensure proper user feedback

## Implementation Approach

### Systematic Gap Analysis

1. Generate current coverage report with detailed uncovered lines identification
2. Categorize untested code by risk level (high/medium/low) and user impact
3. Create testing roadmap prioritizing high-risk, high-impact uncovered code
4. Implement tests incrementally with continuous coverage monitoring

### Test Quality Assurance

- Each new test must include both positive and negative scenarios where applicable
- All async operations must be properly awaited with appropriate timeout handling
- Mock external dependencies consistently to prevent test environment issues
- Validate error messages and user feedback mechanisms in addition to functional behavior

This technical approach ensures we achieve our 85%+ coverage target while maintaining test suite quality and reliability, directly contributing to our 90%+ health score objective for production deployment readiness.
