- Should coordinate data flow between all video studio components

### Integration Tests

**Complete Video Creation Workflow**

- Should allow user to select template, configure video, edit content, preview, and generate
- Should maintain state consistency across all workflow steps
- Should handle browser navigation and maintain workflow state
- Should save work in progress and allow users to resume
- Should handle network interruptions gracefully

**Template to Video Generation Flow**

- Should correctly transform template and user inputs into video generation request
- Should validate all required fields before allowing generation
- Should handle template constraints and prevent invalid configurations
- Should track generation progress and notify user of completion

**Error Recovery Scenarios**

- Should recover from API failures and allow user to retry
- Should handle invalid template data without breaking the interface
- Should recover from preview generation failures
- Should handle video generation failures with clear error messages

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End Video Studio Usage**

- User can browse and select video templates
- User can customize video configuration and content
- User can preview video before final generation
- User can generate final video and download/export results
- User work is preserved across browser sessions
- Multiple users can work on different videos simultaneously

**Cross-Browser Compatibility**

- Video studio works correctly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Video preview and generation work across different browsers
- File uploads and downloads work consistently
- Performance is acceptable across supported browsers

**Performance Scenarios**

- Video studio loads within 2 seconds on standard connections
- Template selection and filtering are responsive with 100+ templates
- Preview generation completes within 10 seconds for standard configurations
- Final video generation provides progress updates every 2 seconds
- Component updates don't cause unnecessary re-renders

### Mocking Requirements

**API Service Mocks**

- **Video Generation API:** Mock video generation requests with realistic progress updates and completion responses
- **Template Service:** Mock template loading with various scenarios (success, failure, empty results)
- **Asset Upload Service:** Mock file upload with progress tracking and validation
- **Preview Generation:** Mock preview generation with realistic timing and failure scenarios

**External Service Mocks**

- **Creatomate API:** Mock video rendering service responses
- **File Storage:** Mock Supabase storage operations for assets and generated videos
- **Authentication:** Mock user authentication state and permissions

**State Management Mocks**

- **Local Storage:** Mock browser storage for testing persistence
- **Context Providers:** Mock React Context for isolated component testing
- **Custom Hooks:** Mock hook return values for testing component behavior
