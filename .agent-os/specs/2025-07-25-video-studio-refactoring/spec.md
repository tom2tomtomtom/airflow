> Spec: Video Studio Component Refactoring
> Created: 2025-07-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Refactor the monolithic 1,257-line VideoStudioPage component into 8-10 focused, single-responsibility components to improve maintainability, testability, and development velocity while preserving all existing functionality.

## User Stories

### Developer Productivity Enhancement

As a developer working on the video studio features, I want the video studio code to be organized into focused components, so that I can quickly locate, understand, and modify specific functionality without navigating through a massive single file.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developer needs to modify video generation logic → locates GenerationControls component → makes focused changes → tests specific component → deploys with confidence that other video studio features are unaffected.

### Component Reusability

As a developer building related video features, I want video studio sub-components to be reusable, so that I can leverage existing video configuration, template selection, and preview functionality in other parts of the application.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developer building new video feature → imports VideoTemplateSelector component → configures props for specific use case → integrates with existing video creation workflow → reduces development time by 60%.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

As a QA engineer testing video studio functionality, I want each video studio component to be independently testable, so that I can write focused unit tests and quickly identify the source of any issues.

**Detailed Workflow:** Bug reported in video generation → QA runs tests for GenerationControls component → identifies specific component failure → developer fixes isolated issue → deploys targeted fix without affecting other video studio features.

## Spec Scope

1. **Component Decomposition** - Break VideoStudioPage into 8-10 focused components with clear responsibilities
2. **State Management Extraction** - Extract video generation state into custom hooks for reusability
3. **Props Interface Design** - Design clean, type-safe props interfaces between components
4. **Event Handling Optimization** - Implement efficient event handling patterns to prevent unnecessary re-renders
5. **Performance Preservation** - Maintain or improve current video studio performance metrics

## Out of Scope

- Changing existing video studio functionality or user interface design
- Modifying video generation API integration or external service calls
- Adding new video studio features or capabilities
- Changing database schema or data structures
- Modifying authentication or permission logic

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Modular Component Architecture** - VideoStudioPage component under 200 lines with focused sub-components
2. **Improved Developer Experience** - Clear component boundaries enable faster feature development and debugging
3. **Enhanced Testability** - Each component can be unit tested independently with focused test suites
