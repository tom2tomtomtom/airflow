## Mocking Requirements

### Service Mocking Strategy

**API Response Mocking**

- Mock successful API responses for each service method
- Mock various error scenarios (network errors, validation errors, server errors)
- Mock edge cases (empty responses, malformed data, timeout scenarios)
- Mock authentication failures and token expiration

**External Service Mocking**

- Mock file upload services for AssetService tests
- Mock authentication providers for AuthService tests
- Mock caching layer for service performance tests
- Mock logging service for error handling tests

**Database Mocking**

- Mock database responses for service layer tests
- Mock transaction scenarios for complex operations
- Mock data consistency scenarios
- Mock database connection failures

### React Testing Library Integration

**Component Testing with Services**

- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking in component tests
- Mock service hooks for isolated component testing
- Test component behavior with various service states
- Test error boundaries with service failures

**Custom Hook Testing**

- Use @testing-library/react-hooks for hook testing
- Mock underlying services for hook unit tests
- Test hook state changes and side effects
- Test hook cleanup and memory leaks

## Coverage Targets

### Code Coverage Goals

- **Service Layer:** 90%+ line coverage, 85%+ branch coverage
- **Custom Hooks:** 85%+ line coverage, 80%+ branch coverage
- **Component Integration:** 80%+ line coverage, 75%+ branch coverage
- **Error Handling Paths:** 95%+ coverage of error scenarios

### Functional Coverage Goals

- **API Interactions:** 100% coverage of all API endpoints used by services
- **Error Scenarios:** 95% coverage of error handling and recovery paths
- **Edge Cases:** 90% coverage of edge cases and boundary conditions

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Strategy

**Fixture Data**

- Create comprehensive test fixtures for all data models
- Maintain realistic test data that reflects production scenarios
- Version test data to prevent test brittleness
- Provide factories for generating varied test data

**Database Test Data**

- Use database seeding for integration tests
- Implement proper test data cleanup between tests
- Create isolated test environments for parallel test execution
- Maintain test data consistency across test runs

### Mock Data Consistency

**Service Mock Consistency**

- Ensure mock responses match actual API response formats
- Keep mocks synchronized with API changes
- Validate mock data against TypeScript interfaces
- Implement mock data validation in CI/CD pipeline
