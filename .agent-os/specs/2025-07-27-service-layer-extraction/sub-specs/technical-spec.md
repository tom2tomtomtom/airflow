# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-27-service-layer-extraction/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-27
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Service Architecture Pattern

- Follow the established service class pattern from existing services (copyGenerator.ts, templateEngine.ts, etc.)
- Implement consistent error handling using the existing error classification system
- Use the established caching system with Redis for data that benefits from caching
- Implement proper logging using the existing logger infrastructure
- Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements with proper type definitions

### Component Refactoring Strategy

- Maintain existing component interfaces and props to avoid breaking changes
- Extract business logic while preserving current UI behavior and user experience
- Use custom hooks as the bridge between components and services for clean separation
- Implement proper loading and error states in components using extracted services
- Maintain backwards compatibility during the refactoring process

### Service Interface Design

- Create consistent service interfaces with standard CRUD operations
- Implement proper dependency injection for services to enable testing
- Use async/await patterns consistently across all service methods
- Implement proper error boundaries and graceful error handling
- Create typed interfaces for all service methods and return values

### Performance Considerations

- Implement intelligent caching strategies to reduce API calls
- Use service-level data deduplication to prevent redundant operations
- Implement proper cleanup and resource management in services
- Optimize service method calls to reduce component re-renders
- Use proper memoization strategies in custom hooks

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Incremental Component-by-Component Extraction

- Pros: Lower risk, easier to test, gradual improvement
- Cons: Longer timeline, potential for inconsistent patterns during transition

**Option B:** Service-First Complete Extraction (Selected)

- Pros: Consistent architecture from start, cleaner end result, faster overall completion
- Cons: Higher initial complexity, requires more comprehensive testing

**Option C:** Context-by-Context Migration

- Pros: Natural boundaries, easier to track progress
- Cons: May miss cross-cutting concerns, potential for service duplication

**Rationale:** Option B is selected because it ensures architectural consistency and leverages the existing well-structured services as patterns. The codebase already has good service examples, making a comprehensive approach more feasible and beneficial in the long term.

## External Dependencies

### New Service Dependencies

- **@/lib/logger** - Already exists, will be used for consistent logging across services
- **@/lib/cache/redis-cache** - Already exists, will be used for service-level caching
- **@/lib/error-handling/error-classifier** - Already exists, will be used for consistent error handling

### Enhanced Type Definitions

- **@/types/services** - Already exists, will be extended with new service interfaces
- **@/types/models** - Already exists, will be enhanced with proper service return types

**Justification:** All dependencies already exist in the codebase, ensuring consistency with established patterns and avoiding new external library additions that could impact bundle size or introduce new maintenance overhead.

## Service Layer Architecture

### Core Services to Extract

1. **ClientService** - Centralize all client-related operations
   - CRUD operations for clients
   - Client filtering and search
   - Active client state management
   - Client data validation and transformation

2. **AssetService** - Manage all asset operations
   - File upload and processing
   - Asset organization and tagging
   - Asset search and filtering
   - Asset metadata management

3. **CampaignService** - Handle campaign lifecycle
   - Campaign creation and modification
   - Campaign state management
   - Campaign validation and business rules
   - Campaign analytics and reporting

4. **AuthService** - Centralize authentication logic
   - User authentication state
   - Token management and refresh
   - Session handling
   - Authentication validation

5. **APIService** - Unified API client
   - Consistent HTTP client interface
   - Request/response interceptors
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - API endpoint management

### Custom Hooks as Service Bridges

- Create useClientService, useAssetService, etc. hooks
- Handle React-specific concerns (loading states, error states, re-renders)
- Provide clean interfaces for components to interact with services
- Manage service lifecycle within React component lifecycle

### Error Handling Strategy

- Use existing error classification system for consistent error types
- Implement service-level error recovery strategies
- Provide meaningful error messages for UI consumption
- Log errors appropriately for debugging and monitoring

### Caching Strategy

- Implement intelligent caching for frequently accessed data
- Use existing Redis cache infrastructure
- Implement cache invalidation strategies for data consistency
- Balance performance gains with data freshness requirements
