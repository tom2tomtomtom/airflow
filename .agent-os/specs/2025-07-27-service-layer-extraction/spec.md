> Spec: Service Layer Extraction
> Created: 2025-07-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Extract business logic from UI components into dedicated service layers to improve code maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns. This refactoring will systematically move data fetching, business rules, and complex state management from React components into well-structured service classes, following the established patterns in the existing services/ directory.

## User Stories

### Clean Component Architecture

As a developer, I want React components to focus purely on presentation logic, so that components are easier to understand, test, and maintain without complex business logic mixed in.

The current codebase has business logic scattered throughout components like ClientContext, EnhancedClientSelector, and other UI components. These components handle API calls, data transformation, caching, and business rules directly within their render logic. After extraction, components will only handle UI state, user interactions, and rendering, while services handle all business operations.

### Improved Testability

As a developer, I want to test business logic independently from UI components, so that unit tests can validate business rules without mounting React components or dealing with UI complexity.

Currently, testing business logic requires mounting entire component trees with complex context providers. With extracted services, business logic can be tested in isolation with simple unit tests, while component tests can focus on user interactions and rendering.

### Better Code Reusability

As a developer, I want business logic to be reusable across different components and contexts, so that the same operations can be used in multiple parts of the application without code duplication.

Business logic is currently tied to specific components, making it difficult to reuse data fetching or business rules in different contexts. Service layers will provide consistent interfaces that can be used by any component or even API routes.

## Spec Scope

1. **Client Management Service** - Extract client CRUD operations, filtering, and state management from ClientContext and related components
2. **Asset Management Service** - Extract file upload, organization, and metadata operations from asset-related components
3. **Campaign Management Service** - Extract campaign creation, modification, and status management logic
4. **Authentication Service** - Extract authentication state management and token handling from AuthContext
5. **API Service Layer** - Create consistent API clients for all backend interactions with proper error handling
6. **Cache Management Service** - Extract caching logic and implement consistent cache strategies across services

## Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of existing components (maintain existing UI/UX)
- Changes to the database schema or API endpoints
- Migration of existing services (copyGenerator, templateEngine, etc.) that are already well-structured
- Performance optimizations beyond those naturally gained from better separation of concerns

## Expected Deliverable

1. All React components focus only on presentation logic with business logic extracted to services
2. Comprehensive service layer following established patterns in src/services/
3. Improved test coverage with separate unit tests for business logic and component rendering
4. Reduced component complexity and improved code maintainability metrics
5. Consistent error handling and caching strategies across all services
6. Documentation for the new service architecture and usage patterns
