# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-27-build-performance-optimization/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-27
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Memory Usage Optimization

- Webpack configuration optimization to use <4GB heap memory during build
- TypeScript compiler settings tuned for memory efficiency with incremental compilation
- Node.js memory flags and garbage collection optimization for build processes
- Build process monitoring to track memory usage patterns and identify bottlenecks
- CI/CD pipeline adjustments to work within memory constraints

### Bundle Size Reduction

- Code splitting implementation to achieve chunks <50MB each
- Tree shaking configuration to eliminate unused code from production bundles
- Vendor bundle optimization to separate third-party libraries efficiently
- Dynamic imports for non-critical components and routes
- Asset optimization including image compression and font subsetting

### Build Process Enhancement

- Incremental TypeScript compilation with persistent cache
- Webpack build cache configuration for faster subsequent builds
- Parallel processing configuration for multi-core build optimization
- Source map optimization for development vs production builds
- Build artifact analysis and monitoring

### Performance Measurement

- Bundle analyzer integration with size tracking and alerts
- Build time and memory usage monitoring in CI/CD pipeline
- Performance regression detection with automated alerts
- Detailed metrics dashboard for build optimization tracking

## Approach Options

**Option A: Incremental Optimization**

- Pros: Lower risk, gradual improvement, easier debugging
- Cons: Slower progress, may not achieve target reductions, partial solutions

**Option B: Comprehensive Build System Overhaul**

- Pros: Maximum performance gains, modern build practices, future-proof
- Cons: Higher risk, potential for breaking changes, requires extensive testing

**Option C: Targeted Critical Path Optimization** (Selected)

- Pros: Balance of significant improvement with controlled risk, focused on biggest impact areas
- Cons: May require follow-up optimization phases, some low-hanging fruit left unaddressed

**Rationale:** Option C provides the best balance of achieving critical performance targets while minimizing risk. By focusing on memory optimization and bundle splitting as the highest impact areas, we can achieve the required 50% memory reduction and 38% bundle size reduction with manageable implementation complexity.
