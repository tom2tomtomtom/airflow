# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Build Performance Optimization for Production Deployment
> Created: 2025-07-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Optimize AIRWAVE's build performance to reduce memory usage from 8GB to <4GB and bundle size from 483MB to <300MB, enabling production deployment without infrastructure constraints while maintaining current build speed.

## User Stories

### Development Team Efficiency

As a developer, I want the build process to use less than 4GB of memory, so that I can build the application on standard development machines without memory allocation issues.

This change eliminates the need for special build configurations and allows the development team to build locally without hitting memory limits. The optimization also reduces CI/CD costs by enabling builds on smaller instances.

### Production Deployment Readiness

As a platform operator, I want the bundle size optimized to <300MB with efficient code splitting, so that users experience faster page loads and the application meets enterprise performance requirements.

This optimization directly contributes to improved user experience through faster initial load times, reduced bandwidth usage, and better performance on mobile devices and slower connections.

### Infrastructure Cost Optimization

As a technical stakeholder, I want build processes optimized for standard hardware, so that deployment costs are minimized and the platform can scale without infrastructure constraints.

The memory reduction enables deployment on cost-effective hosting tiers while the bundle optimization reduces CDN bandwidth costs and improves cache efficiency.

## Spec Scope

1. **Memory Usage Optimization** - Reduce Webpack and TypeScript compilation memory from 8GB to <4GB through configuration optimization and build process improvements
2. **Bundle Size Reduction** - Implement code splitting, tree shaking, and vendor optimization to reduce bundle from 483MB to <300MB
3. **Build Process Enhancement** - Configure incremental builds, caching optimization, and parallel processing without sacrificing build speed
4. **Performance Measurement** - Establish monitoring and metrics for build performance to track improvements and prevent regression
5. **Documentation & Guidelines** - Create developer documentation for optimized build practices and troubleshooting guides

## Out of Scope

- Runtime performance optimization (handled by separate performance specs)
- Database query optimization
- Third-party service integration performance
- Server-side rendering optimization beyond bundle size impacts
- CSS optimization beyond critical path extraction

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Build memory usage reduced to <4GB** - Verified through local builds and CI/CD pipeline monitoring
2. **Bundle size optimized to <300MB** - Measured through bundle analyzer with detailed size breakdown and chunk analysis
3. **Maintained or improved build times** - No regression in build speed while achieving memory and size targets through parallel processing optimization
