### Integration Tests

**VideoStudioWorkflow**

- Complete video creation flow from template selection to export
- Cross-component state synchronization during editing operations
- Asset integration between media library and canvas components
- Export functionality with various template and format combinations

**ClientManagementWorkflow**

- Full client onboarding process including brand guideline setup
- Client list to detail navigation with proper state management
- Form submission with validation and error handling integration
- Brand guideline application across video creation workflows

**ServiceLayerIntegration**

- Service-to-component data flow validation across refactored modules
- Error propagation from service layer to UI components
- Caching behavior validation between services and React Query
- Authentication integration across all service modules

### Feature Tests

**ComponentModularization**

- Video Studio functionality parity before/after component extraction
- Client management feature completeness across modularized components
- Performance benchmarks comparing monolithic vs modularized implementations
- Bundle size validation for code splitting effectiveness

**ArchitecturalPatterns**

- Service layer abstraction working correctly across all components
- Custom hooks providing consistent state management patterns
- Error boundaries handling failures gracefully in modularized architecture
- TypeScript interface compliance across all refactored components

### Mocking Requirements

**ExternalServices**

- **Supabase Client:** Mock database operations for service layer testing
- **Creatomate API:** Mock video rendering calls for export component testing
- **File Upload Operations:** Mock asset upload/processing for media library testing

**ComponentDependencies**

- **React Query:** Mock caching behavior for service integration testing
- **Context Providers:** Mock parent context for isolated component testing
- **Browser APIs:** Mock drag-drop, file selection, and clipboard operations

**PerformanceMocking**

- **Large Dataset Rendering:** Mock large client lists for performance testing
- **Video Preview Generation:** Mock expensive preview operations for responsiveness testing
- **Network Delays:** Mock API response times for loading state validation

## Testing Implementation Strategy

### Test-Driven Refactoring Approach

1. Write comprehensive tests for existing functionality before extraction
2. Extract component with failing tests (red phase)
3. Implement component to pass tests (green phase)
4. Refactor component implementation while maintaining test passage
5. Add additional tests for edge cases and error scenarios

### Coverage Targets

- **Overall Coverage:** >80% across all refactored components
- **Service Layer:** >90% coverage due to business logic criticality
- **Component Logic:** >75% coverage focusing on user interaction paths
- **Integration Points:** 100% coverage for component communication interfaces

### Performance Testing

- **Render Performance:** Benchmark component render times before/after extraction
- **Bundle Analysis:** Validate code splitting and chunk size improvements
- **Memory Usage:** Monitor memory consumption of modularized components
- **Load Testing:** Stress test with large datasets for scalability validation

## Quality Assurance Validation

### Refactoring Safety Measures

- Existing test suite must maintain 100% passage rate throughout refactoring
- Feature parity validation between original and refactored implementations
- Visual regression testing to ensure UI consistency
- Performance regression testing to validate optimization benefits

### Code Quality Metrics

- Component complexity scores must improve from current baseline
- TypeScript strict mode compliance across all refactored code
- ESLint rule compliance with zero tolerance for new violations
- Test coverage reports for continuous monitoring of quality improvements
