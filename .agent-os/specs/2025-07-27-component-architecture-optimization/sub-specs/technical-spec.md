# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-27-component-architecture-optimization/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-27
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Component Size Constraints

- Individual components must not exceed 200 lines (target: 100-150 lines)
- Single Responsibility Principle: each component has one clear purpose
- Props interface must be clearly defined with TypeScript for all components
- All components must have corresponding unit tests with >80% coverage

### Video Studio Modularization Architecture

- Extract VideoStudioToolbar component for tool selection and configuration
- Create VideoStudioCanvas component for preview and drag-drop functionality
- Separate VideoStudioTimeline component for sequence management
- Implement VideoStudioProperties component for element editing
- Build VideoStudioAssets component for media library integration
- Create VideoStudioExport component for rendering and output options
- Establish VideoStudioProvider context for shared state management
- Implement VideoStudioHooks for complex state logic extraction

### Client Management Architecture

- ClientList component for data display with pagination and filtering
- ClientForm component for create/edit operations with validation
- ClientDetail component for individual client information display
- ClientBrandGuidelines component for brand-specific configurations
- ClientService layer for API interactions and business logic
- ClientHooks for state management and data fetching patterns

### Service Layer Implementation

- Create services/ directory structure with domain-specific modules
- Implement ApiService base class for consistent HTTP request patterns
- Build ClientService, CampaignService, AssetService domain services
- Establish error handling patterns with consistent error types
- Implement caching strategies using React Query integration
- Create service interfaces for dependency injection and testing

### Performance Optimization Strategy

- Implement React.memo for expensive component renders
- Use useMemo and useCallback for expensive computations
- Establish code splitting boundaries at component level
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
- Create bundle analysis workflow for monitoring improvements

## Approach Options

**Option A: Big Bang Refactoring**

- Pros: Complete architecture transformation, consistent patterns established immediately
- Cons: High risk of introducing bugs, significant testing overhead, development velocity impact

**Option B: Incremental Component Extraction** (Selected)

- Pros: Lower risk, continuous value delivery, easier testing and validation
- Cons: Temporary architectural inconsistency, requires discipline to maintain momentum

**Option C: New Architecture Parallel Development**

- Pros: Zero risk to existing functionality, complete design freedom
- Cons: Massive duplication effort, complex migration strategy, resource intensive

**Rationale:** Incremental extraction allows systematic validation of each component's functionality while maintaining development velocity. The approach enables continuous integration of improvements and reduces the risk of introducing breaking changes. Each extracted component can be thoroughly tested before integration, ensuring reliability throughout the refactoring process.

## External Dependencies

**No new external dependencies required** - This refactoring utilizes existing dependencies:

- **React 18.2.0** - Component composition and hooks functionality
- **TypeScript 5.1.6** - Interface definitions and type safety
- **Jest & React Testing Library** - Unit testing framework for extracted components
- **React Query (TanStack Query)** - Existing caching for service layer integration

**Justification:** Leveraging existing dependencies maintains consistency with current architecture while avoiding dependency bloat. The refactoring focuses on architectural improvements rather than introducing new technologies, reducing learning curve and integration complexity.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Video Studio Refactoring (Priority 1)

1. Create component structure and interfaces
2. Extract VideoStudioProvider context for state management
3. Break out toolbar and canvas components first (lowest risk)
4. Progressively extract timeline, properties, and export components
5. Implement comprehensive test suite for each component
6. Validate functionality with existing test suite

### Phase 2: Client Management Modularization (Priority 2)

1. Analyze existing client.tsx component dependencies
2. Extract ClientService for API operations
3. Create ClientList component with existing filtering logic
4. Build ClientForm with validation patterns
5. Implement ClientDetail view with brand guidelines integration
6. Test complete CRUD workflows

### Phase 3: Service Layer Architecture (Priority 3)

1. Design service layer interfaces and base classes
2. Extract API calls from components into service modules
3. Implement error handling and caching patterns
4. Create service hooks for component integration
5. Establish testing patterns for service layer
6. Document service layer usage patterns for team adoption

## Testing Strategy

### Component Testing Approach

- Unit tests for each extracted component using React Testing Library
- Integration tests for component interactions within modularized systems
- Visual regression tests for UI consistency validation
- Performance tests for component rendering benchmarks

### Service Layer Testing

- Mock external API dependencies for isolated service testing
- Integration tests for service-to-component data flow
- Error handling validation for network failures and edge cases
- Caching behavior verification for React Query integration

### Refactoring Validation

- Existing test suite must pass throughout refactoring process
- New test coverage target: >80% for all extracted components
- Performance benchmark comparison before/after refactoring
- Bundle size analysis to validate code splitting improvements
