> Spec: Component Architecture Optimization for Maintainability
> Created: 2025-07-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Systematically refactor AIRWAVE's oversized components and extract service layers to improve code maintainability, reduce complexity score from 15/25 to 23/25, and contribute to achieving 90%+ overall health score. This comprehensive architecture optimization will break down monolithic components, separate business logic from UI, and establish patterns for sustainable development.

## User Stories

### Developer Experience Enhancement

As a developer working on AIRWAVE, I want to work with modular, focused components so that I can understand, modify, and test code more efficiently without navigating through thousands of lines of monolithic files.

The current architecture creates significant developer friction with files like video-studio-original.tsx at 1,257 lines and clients.tsx at 900 lines. Developers spend excessive time understanding context, locating specific functionality, and ensuring changes don't break unrelated features. This refactoring will create clear separation of concerns with focused components under 200 lines each, dedicated service layers for business logic, and comprehensive test coverage for each module.

### Performance and Maintainability Benefits

As a product owner, I want a maintainable codebase architecture so that development velocity increases, technical debt decreases, and new feature development becomes predictable and reliable.

Currently, large components prevent effective code splitting, make testing difficult, and create high risk for introducing bugs. The optimized architecture will enable better bundling strategies, improved testing capabilities, and reduced complexity metrics that directly impact development speed and code quality.

### Code Quality Standards

As a team lead, I want consistent architectural patterns across the codebase so that onboarding new developers is faster, code reviews are more focused, and technical debt accumulation is controlled through established patterns.

The refactoring will establish clear patterns for component composition, service layer integration, custom hook extraction, and testing strategies that can be applied consistently across all future development work.

## Spec Scope

1. **Video Studio Component Modularization** - Break down 1,257-line video-studio-original.tsx into 8-10 focused components with clear responsibilities
2. **Client Management Component Refactoring** - Split 900-line clients.tsx into CRUD-focused modules with dedicated forms, lists, and detail views
3. **Service Layer Extraction** - Create dedicated API service layer separating business logic from UI components across the application
4. **Custom Hooks Library Development** - Extract reusable state management patterns into a centralized custom hooks library
5. **Component Architecture Patterns** - Establish standardized patterns for component composition, prop interfaces, and testing approaches

## Out of Scope

- Major UI/UX redesign or user-facing feature changes
- Database schema modifications or API endpoint changes
- Performance optimization beyond what architectural improvements provide naturally
- Migration to different state management libraries or major dependency updates

## Expected Deliverable

1. Video Studio components reduced from 1,257 lines to 8-10 focused components, each under 200 lines with comprehensive test coverage
2. Clients page components modularized into dedicated CRUD modules with improved code organization and maintainability
3. Service layer architecture implemented with clear separation between API calls, business logic, and UI components
4. Complexity score improvement from 15/25 to 23/25 through systematic component size reduction and logical organization
5. Health score contribution toward 90%+ target through improved maintainability metrics and reduced technical debt
