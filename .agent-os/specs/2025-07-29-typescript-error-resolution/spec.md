# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: TypeScript Error Resolution System
> Created: 2025-07-29
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Systematically resolve 305+ TypeScript compilation errors that are currently blocking production deployment and preventing the codebase from achieving production readiness. This critical technical debt resolution will transform the codebase from a development-only state to a fully production-ready application with strict TypeScript compliance enabled.

## User Stories

### Development Team Story

As a developer on the AIRWAVE team, I want all TypeScript compilation errors resolved, so that we can deploy to production with confidence and maintain code quality standards.

The development workflow currently requires suppressing TypeScript strict mode due to 305+ compilation errors across the codebase. This prevents catching type-related bugs early, makes refactoring dangerous, and blocks production deployment. The resolution will enable strict mode, provide better IDE support, and ensure type safety throughout the application.

### DevOps/Deployment Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want the TypeScript build process to succeed without errors, so that our CI/CD pipeline can deploy to production automatically.

Currently, the build process fails due to TypeScript compilation errors, requiring manual intervention and error suppression. This blocks automated deployments and creates deployment risks. Resolution will enable automated production deployments through GitHub Actions.

### Product Quality Story

As a product manager, I want the codebase to meet production quality standards, so that we can confidently release features without type-related runtime errors.

The suppressed TypeScript errors represent potential runtime bugs and maintenance issues that could affect user experience. Resolving these errors will improve application stability and reduce the likelihood of production issues.

## Spec Scope

1. **Type Definition Refactoring** - Consolidate and properly type the 989-line database.ts file and other monolithic type definitions
2. **Service Layer Type Resolution** - Fix type mismatches in business logic services and API handlers
3. **Component Prop Type Fixes** - Resolve React component prop type errors and interface mismatches
4. **Strict Mode Enablement** - Enable TypeScript strict mode and resolve all resulting compilation errors
5. **Build Process Validation** - Ensure successful TypeScript compilation in both development and production builds

## Out of Scope

- New feature development or functionality changes
- UI/UX improvements or styling modifications
- Database schema changes or data migrations
- Performance optimizations beyond type-related improvements
- Third-party dependency updates (unless required for type fixes)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Zero TypeScript compilation errors in both development and production builds
2. TypeScript strict mode enabled in tsconfig.json with all strict flags active
3. Production deployment pipeline successfully building and deploying without type-related failures
