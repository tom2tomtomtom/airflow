# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-29-typescript-error-resolution/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-29
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### TypeScript Configuration
- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json with all strict flags: strict, noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks, strictFunctionTypes, strictBindCallApply, strictPropertyInitialization, noImplicitReturns, noFallthroughCasesInSwitch
- Ensure skipLibCheck is false to catch library-related type issues
- Configure proper module resolution and target settings for Next.js compatibility
- Maintain existing path mapping and module aliases

### Type Definition Refactoring
- Break down database.ts (989 lines) into focused, single-responsibility type modules
- Create proper interfaces for Supabase database types with generated type safety
- Implement proper generic constraints for complex data structures
- Establish consistent naming conventions for types, interfaces, and enums
- Create type guards and validation utilities for runtime type checking

### Service Layer Type Safety
- Define proper input/output types for all API endpoints and service functions
- Implement proper error handling types with discriminated unions
- Create typed wrappers for external API calls (OpenAI, Supabase, etc.)
- Establish proper async/await typing patterns with proper error handling
- Define proper types for background job payloads and responses

### Component Type Resolution
- Define proper Props interfaces for all React components with strict typing
- Implement proper ref forwarding types for component composition
- Create properly typed custom hooks with correct dependency arrays
- Define proper event handler types with correct parameter typing
- Establish consistent patterns for conditional rendering and optional props

### Build Process Integration
- Configure TypeScript compiler to fail builds on any type errors
- Set up proper type checking in GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent type errors from being committed
- Configure IDE integration for real-time type error detection
- Establish type coverage reporting and monitoring

## Approach Options

**Option A: Gradual Migration with Error Suppression**
- Pros: Non-disruptive to current development, allows parallel work
- Cons: Risk of regression, longer timeline, potential for incomplete resolution

**Option B: Big Bang Resolution with Development Freeze** (Selected)
- Pros: Complete resolution guaranteed, enables strict mode immediately, prevents new errors
- Cons: Blocks other development temporarily, requires focused effort

**Option C: File-by-File Systematic Resolution**
- Pros: Measurable progress, allows some parallel work, reduces risk
- Cons: Complex dependency management, potential for missed interconnections

**Rationale:** Option B is selected because the TypeScript errors are currently blocking production deployment (P0 Critical). A systematic, complete resolution is needed to enable strict mode and production readiness. The scale of errors (305+) suggests that partial fixes would likely introduce new issues due to interconnected type dependencies.

## Error Categories and Resolution Strategy

### Database Type Errors (Estimated 40% of errors)
- **Root Cause:** Monolithic database.ts file with inconsistent type definitions
- **Resolution:** Generate proper Supabase types using their CLI, create focused type modules
- **Tools:** Supabase type generation, TypeScript utility types

### Service Layer Errors (Estimated 25% of errors)
- **Root Cause:** Loose typing in API handlers and business logic
- **Resolution:** Define proper input/output schemas, implement type guards
- **Tools:** Zod for runtime validation, proper async typing patterns

### Component Prop Errors (Estimated 20% of errors)
- **Root Cause:** Inconsistent React component typing, missing prop interfaces
- **Resolution:** Define proper Props interfaces, implement ref forwarding
- **Tools:** React TypeScript patterns, forwardRef typing

### Utility and Helper Errors (Estimated 15% of errors)
- **Root Cause:** Generic utility functions without proper type constraints
- **Resolution:** Add proper generic constraints and type guards
- **Tools:** TypeScript utility types, type predicates

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
2. Audit and categorize all 305+ TypeScript errors
3. Set up proper build failure on type errors
4. Create error tracking and resolution documentation

### Phase 2: Database Type Refactoring
1. Generate fresh Supabase types using official tooling
2. Break down database.ts into focused modules (users, campaigns, assets, etc.)
3. Implement proper generic constraints for database operations
4. Create type-safe query builders and response handlers

### Phase 3: Service Layer Resolution
1. Define proper API endpoint input/output types
2. Implement type-safe error handling patterns
3. Create typed wrappers for external service integrations
4. Establish consistent async/await typing patterns

### Phase 4: Component Type Safety
1. Define proper Props interfaces for all React components
2. Implement proper ref forwarding and component composition types
3. Create type-safe custom hooks with proper dependency typing
4. Resolve all event handler and callback typing issues

### Phase 5: Build Integration and Validation
1. Configure TypeScript compiler for strict error checking in CI/CD
2. Implement pre-commit type checking hooks
3. Validate production build process with full type checking
4. Document type patterns and standards for future development

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies required. All necessary tools are already available:

- **TypeScript 5.1.6** - Already installed, core compiler
- **Supabase CLI** - For type generation (already available)
- **Zod** - Already installed for runtime validation
- **ESLint TypeScript Rules** - Already configured for linting

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Success Metrics
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors in development build
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors in production build  
- Successful deployment to production without type-related failures
- TypeScript strict mode enabled with all strict flags active

### Long-term Success Metrics
- No regression of TypeScript errors in future development
- Improved IDE experience with better type inference and autocomplete
- Reduced runtime type-related errors in production
- Faster development velocity due to better type safety and refactoring confidence
