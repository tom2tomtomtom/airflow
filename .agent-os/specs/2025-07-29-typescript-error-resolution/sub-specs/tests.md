## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Type Guard Functions**
- Test type predicate functions return correct boolean values for valid/invalid inputs
- Test runtime type validation with edge cases and malformed data
- Test generic type constraints work properly with various input types

**Database Type Utilities**
- Test Supabase type generation produces correct TypeScript interfaces
- Test database query type safety with proper input/output typing
- Test type-safe database operations handle errors correctly

**Service Layer Type Safety**
- Test API endpoint input validation with proper error handling
- Test service function type constraints work with various parameter combinations
- Test async/await typing patterns handle promises and errors correctly

**Component Type Resolution**
- Test React component Props interfaces accept valid props and reject invalid ones
- Test ref forwarding types work correctly with component composition
- Test custom hook typing maintains proper type inference

### Integration Tests

**TypeScript Compilation**
- Test entire codebase compiles successfully with strict mode enabled
- Test production build process completes without TypeScript errors
- Test development build process maintains type checking performance

**Build Process Integration**
- Test GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline fails on TypeScript errors
- Test pre-commit hooks prevent commits with type errors
- Test type checking integration with existing linting and formatting tools

**Cross-Module Type Safety**
- Test type imports and exports work correctly across module boundaries
- Test complex type compositions maintain proper inference
- Test generic type constraints work across service boundaries

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End Type Safety Validation**
- Test complete user workflow maintains type safety from UI to database
- Test error scenarios produce properly typed error responses
- Test async operations maintain type safety throughout the promise chain

**Production Deployment Validation**
- Test production build deploys successfully with zero TypeScript errors
- Test runtime type checking works properly in production environment
- Test type safety doesn't impact application performance or functionality

### Mocking Requirements

**External Service Types**
- **Supabase Client:** Mock database operations while maintaining type safety
- **OpenAI API:** Mock AI service responses with proper typing
- **File Upload Services:** Mock file operations with proper type constraints

**Development Environment**
- **TypeScript Compiler:** Mock compiler errors for testing error handling
- **Build Process:** Mock build failures to test CI/CD integration
- **IDE Integration:** Test type checking works properly in development environment

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Automated Type Checking Tests
- Set up Jest tests that invoke TypeScript compiler programmatically
- Create test scenarios that verify specific type constraints are enforced
- Implement regression tests to prevent future type errors

### Build Process Validation
- Create GitHub Actions workflow that runs TypeScript compilation as separate step
- Configure build to fail fast on any type errors before attempting deployment
- Set up notification system for type-related build failures

### Pre-commit Validation
- Configure Husky pre-commit hooks to run TypeScript type checking
- Set up lint-staged to run type checking only on changed files for performance
- Create developer documentation for resolving common type errors

### Continuous Monitoring
- Implement type coverage reporting to track type safety improvements
- Set up automated checks for TypeScript version compatibility
- Create dashboard for monitoring type-related metrics and errors

## Success Criteria for Testing

### Immediate Test Goals
- All existing tests continue to pass after type fixes
- New type-related tests achieve 100% pass rate
- TypeScript compilation tests pass in both development and production modes

### Long-term Test Goals  
- Type regression tests prevent future TypeScript errors
- Performance tests show no significant impact from strict type checking
- Integration tests validate type safety across all system boundaries

### Quality Assurance Metrics
- Zero tolerance for TypeScript compilation errors in any environment
- Type coverage reporting shows improvement in type safety
- Developer feedback indicates improved development experience with better type support
